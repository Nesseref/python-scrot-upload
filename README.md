# python-scrot-upload

A simple python script to call scrot, upload the resulting screenshot to Will Host For Fnord (https://whff.frogbox.es), and save the result locally. Intended to be called by a window manager key shortcut.

Now can also upload the (text) contents of the clipboard.

Depends on python-clipboard, python-requests and scrot.
